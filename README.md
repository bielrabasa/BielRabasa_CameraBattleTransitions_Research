## Introduction
Transitions have existed since the first films were made, and have made it to this day changing its original purposes to serve in other audiovisual creations.
Transitions are mainly used in films, presentations and videogames.

The main purpose for transitions is to occult abrupt cuts between different scenes.

## Types of transitions
There are two big groups in transition-making, the easiest one is to put a color card in front of the image to hide the cut. This is mostly done in black, with the most famous transition being the "fade to black". For the second type of transition, it consists in manipulating the current images and work with them (or additional images) to combine the scenes, the moost famous transition for this type is "dissolve".

## Exercices
The Camera Transitions Exercice release is a project to analyse and complete to understand how transitions work in SDL2. Once completed, there is a solution to the exercice in the SOLVED release.
